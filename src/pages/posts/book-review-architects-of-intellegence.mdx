## What the book is about

This book follows a series of interviews with researchers, developers and thought-leaders at the forefront of the AI revolution.
It talks about the current landspace of the industry and the possibility of a breakthrough in artificial general intellegence. 

## My key-takeaways
- ***Deep learning is limited***: Take AlphaGo. An agent developed my DeepMind that beat the best human player in the ancient chinese game of Go. As monumental as that is,
we are not still any closer to achieving any kind of general intellegence. Even AlphaZero, AlphaGo's slightly generalized version, 
can only play two-player fully observable board games. It cannot play a game of partial information - like poker. So as of right now, our agents
can only complete one task that it has been specifically trained for. 

- ***Hybrid systems - deep learning + reinforcement learning + unsupervised learning + human written rules - could be the path to AGI***: Deep learning will play a big role in developing AGI but it's limitations mean it cannot be the only technique we use. 
In humans, learning happens via our dopamine system, where the synapses in our brain are strengthened when they receive reward signals. We can mimic
this in an AI by asking it to repeatedly do a task and reward it everytime it succeeds. This is called reinforcement learning.
